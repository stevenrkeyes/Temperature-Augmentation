This project is code for a system that transduces readings from a IR thermometer into sensations perceivable by a user wearing the system. In this way, it augments a person's sense of temperature to include the perception of the temperature of distant objects in addition to near objects. 

This is code for a final project for Human 2.0: Principles of Human Augmentation (MAS.600) at MIT.
